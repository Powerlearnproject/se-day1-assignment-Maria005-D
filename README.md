# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 Software engineering is a branch of computer science used for developing, testing 
 and maintaining software.
 it ensures high quality software development by following structured 
 methodologies to produce error-free, well documented and maintainable code
 it improves efficiency and productivity by streamlining development processes 
 with frameworks,reusable code and automation tools
 enhances scalability and performance by ensuring applications are optimized for 
 speed and responsiveness
 strengthens cybersecurity and data protection by implementing secure coding 
 practices to prevent cyber threats



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
mastering complexity
  early softwares were difficult to manage hence leading to frequent failueres.
  This led to intorduction of strctured programming ,developmeny of modular 
  programming  and creation of object-oriented programming.
mastering process
  As software projects grew larger, quality and effieciency in development became 
  crucial
  This led to adoption of software development life cycle models like waterfall, 
  emergence of agile methodologies and introduction of DevOps to integrate 
  development and operations
mastering machine
   The rise of powerful hardware and distibuted systems required new software 
  engineering approaches that include growth of cloud computing , adoption of AI- 
  driven development and expansion of parallel and distributed computing to handle 
  big data


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
planning - define project goals,s cope, budget and timeline and identify risks and feasibility
requirement analysis - gathering and documenting user and system requirements and ensure clarity through stakeholder discussions
Design - create system architecture and software design and aslo define databases and security measures
Implementation - this is writing of te actual code based on the design
Testing - it is identifying and fixing of bugs and ensuring that the software is working as expected
Deployment - it is the release of the software for theend users
Maintenace - it is providing of updates,bug fixing and making improvements. It is also monitoring performance of the system and addressing user feedback


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
